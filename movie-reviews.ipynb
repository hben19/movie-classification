It is important to set a set side a validation data to see if the model performs well on a never seen dataset. By setting num_words to 10,000 we are selecting the 10,000 most frequently used words."

I have choosen a network which performs well on such a problem a simple stack of fully connected Dense Layers, where the hidden layers will use relu as their activation function. Relu is an activiation function which turn a value into 0 if the number is less than 0 and leave the positive number as it was e.g relu(-3,2) = (0,2). Relu is the most common activation function in Deep Learning and we need it to extend the hypothesis space.\n",
